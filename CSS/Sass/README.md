**sass --watch input.scss output.css**  
You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this example:

**sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets**  
Sass would watch all files in the app/sass folder for changes, and compile CSS to the public/stylesheets folder.
